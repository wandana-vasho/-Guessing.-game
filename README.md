# 🎮 Number Guessing Game – Python Project

## 📌 About the Project
This is a simple Python-based **Number Guessing Game** with two modes:
1. **User Guess Mode** – You try to guess the computer's random number.
2. **Computer Guess Mode** – The computer tries to guess the number you have in mind.

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates the use of:
- Random number generation
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements (`if/elif/else`)
- User input handling

---

## ✨ Features
- Interactive gameplay 🎲  
- Two game modes:  
  ✅ User guesses the number  
  ✅ Computer guesses the number  
- Beginner-friendly Python script 🐍
